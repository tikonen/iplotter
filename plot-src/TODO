* legend
  * click on data item -> toggle on/off
  - double-click -> edit ?

* nollaviiva tummempana -> punaisena

* sarakkeen nimet
 - erikoismerkki sarakkeennimen perässä olis flagi
   = piirrä impulse graph

- zoom
 - should show both source & destination boxes and lines connecting box corners
 - arrows in both end of lines should show zoom direction
 - possibly animate zoom, following the lines

* (plot2:18891): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: gsignal.c:1709: signal `change-value' is invalid for instance `0x89603a8'
 => disable the scroller

- average of 30 minutes (for example) to detect trends - could we maybe use cumulative value and just calc the diff?
  - <Mulleteer> tuumin sellaista, että plottien summaaminen ja keskiarvoistaminen olisi aika tärkeä ominaisuus
  - <Mulleteer> x[n] = (x[n-2] + x[n-1] + x[n])/3
  - <Mulleteer> ylipäästösuodin voisi olla kanssa mukava, näkisi vain poikkeamat

* collect errors during data load into string, not to stdout

* draw to off-screen buffer

* BUG: minpermaj = 0 seems to be due to bug in __attrubute__ ((const)) implementation in older compilers - using ((pure)) instead

- autoconf to check which gcc warning flags are supported
 * used "simple" makefile target instead

* cursor change when ctrl etc used on drawingarea

* tail using separate process or FAM

* (gtk)labelit jotka ilmaisee aikavälin ei aina päivity - ilmeisesti ei myöskään aina se entry siellä alaoikeassa nurkassa.. - pitäis olla korjattuna

* the Show all button (and menu item) should be disabled when fully zoomed out

- export options:
  - show legend
  - preview

(IN MANTIS partially)
- bookmarkit käyttöön - pystyviiva ja pallero jossa numero ja tooltip-tyyliin saa selityksen, exportissa vois olla lista alalaidassa
    * piirto (palleron sijasta tuli kolmio ja numero on vieressä jos sitäkään)
    - export-piirto
    - lataus & mergaus nykyiseen plot_draw:hon
    - tallennus jokaiseen aukinaiseen fileeseen
    - bookmark categories: "bookmark (category) text" - category not included in label
      - category can be used to select color

- HMMM kun actual_samples_per_pixel > x (x >= 1) piirrä normaaliviivojen sijasta min ja max:n väliin viivat (min1->min2 min1->max2 max1->min1 max1->max2) tai (min1->max1, avg1->avg2) tai jotain

- draw in background thread maybe?

* try optimizing parse_double_num - mikko did some testing with oprofile

- try optimizing parse_timestamp_num to parse floating numbers into fixed integers directly

* while(gtk_events_pending()) -> system_check_events()

* at least some kind of keyboard graph navigation (arrows and some modifiers used for move / scale)

* use TRAC + subversion (used mantis + cvs instead :)

* support tail mode - disables top 3 x scrollbars and locks the center pos to the right - also moving & zooming with mouse shall override x = max x to zoom with center along right border
  * fix zoom area to lock to right border
  - check how history is handled
  - generalize the tailing support in plot2.xc to not be fam-specific
  - support reverting file in case it was truncated
  - options dialog:
    - always "show all" y axis
    - always "show all visible" y axis
    - always "show all" x axis

* marker bugs (when moving mouse without pressed buttons in plot area)
  * partial reveal of window leaves partial markers
  * when new file loaded, markers go bad if cursor was in window when loading finished
  * sometimes when zooming fast, a duplicate of the markers is left

- zoompoint bug - if y axis range increases, the zoompoint is moved even if display stays the same
  - to reproduce: tail a file whose value is increasing all the time

- after clicking the history back/forward buttons, the old (and now bogus) markers still remain until you dehoover & hoover the button again

* preview with minigraph - load 100-200 samples from file with even intervals

* move update_minmax() and plot_clone to plot_draw.xc
  * actually extracted only parts that were named plot_draw_calc_x_minmax() and plot_draw_calc_y_minmax().

* nollaviivan piirto exportissa bugasi

- LOW option for choosing resizing behaviour between a) keeping the same [xy]off + [xy]length b) keep graph pixel size same when zooming, "zoom" around zoompoint

- investigate if strikethrough and maybe also underline position fetching from layout and/or font through paintapi is possible - could be used to align legend color boxes to the center of the text

* Menu -> Options -> Show hidden lines in legend
  - 15:43 <Pasi> Toi legend voi tulla vaikeakäyttäiseksi jos dataa on paljon

* multiview - support for multiple graphs on top of each other, sharing x axis
  - zoom history in init, free & clone
  - if view[0] is released, check what happens to references to view[0]
  * add plot_view_need_redraw() and use it where it's enough
  * *_markers() should be view-specific and maybe one global hide_all_markers() .. or?
  * time marker should show up in all views
  * update_minmax view-specific

- multiwindow
  - view defaults copied in clone?
  - dataset callback from update_dataset() when an update happened

- try to group uses of contexts when calling draw_* functions to avoid switching contexts often for paintapi platforms where it's expensive
  * labels separate, but minor & major lines still drawn randomly

- inverse code should be in plot_draw, not in paintapi (?)

* convert filenames to utf-8 using nl_langinfo(CODESET) + iconv
  MT: I think gtk automatically uses the LC_CTYPE as filename encoding
  * added system-specific filename_to_utf8() function which uses glib
    functions in gtk implementation

- invent a name! plotteri, splot, dplot, plotter, ....?

- draw some hi-res icon

* gettext maybe ? intltool-extract --type "gettext/glade" plot.glade ; xgettext -a -c -o plot.po plot.glade.h

* sample densityä säädettäessä kaakkoon niin autoredraw lakkas toimimasta ja lopulta segfaulttasi - apply piirsi mutta resize ei

* test.txt has bad x axis values

* maybe draw lines & numbers on top of graphs

* gui toggle for disabling extra lines following mouse cursor

- option to store meta-data at the end of the sample file -> the meta-data is always available

* if mouse is moved while it's redrawing, extra dotted lines appear in plot

- add to zoom history when user lets go of scrollbar

- add to zoom history when user stops scrolling with keyboard for 1.5 secs
  isn't this done already?

* check paintapi_direct usage and possibly add "_restore_after_draw()" functions

- check gdk_*() usage - verify if paintapi should be used instead

* fix plot problems (sample-bad*.txt) - see README.PLOT_REWRITE

- x axis legend texts jump up & down (swap places) when panning along x-axis (sample_bad1b.txt)

- major & minor grid min_per_maj broken (use sample_bad1b.txt)

* step function implemented but gui doesnt support it - maybe in prefs view?

- enable user to affect plot_draw.time_off

- implement autoexport_every (menuitem already added in plot-fastcommit/plot.glade)

- commandline export font size is different than in GUI

- [epa] view bookmarks
  - animated panning between bookmarks with zoom out + zoom in between to better visualize where we are going

- [epa] show zoom of current pixel in smaller overlay window (requires numbers for line values at current time to be shown somewhere)

- [epa] view zoompoint, remove zoompoint scrollbars

- aalib ^^

- timezone adjust (use TZ by default)

- tail only files that have enabled lines

- option to have legend outside plot (to the left or right) i.e. shrink the width of the plot area.. otoh this requries clipping to be taken into use :P

- the list of open files and datasets at the bottom could have an option to drop data files and perhaps also lines from memory

- the open dialog could have options for selecting which lines to import, otoh this might slow down loading when all lines are selected

- is the sample averaging process weighted by time or not ? if not, maybe there should be an option for it..
   - non_weighted_average_demo.plot

- nul/nil/zero/'\0' bytes in input cause reading to be aborted in the middle of the file, but tail "finds" more stuff later

* if there are more labels than necessary during initial load, they are not picked up later if more data columns appear

- there should be a vertical dashed line when adding bookmarks, just like when the cursor is inside the plot, while the horizontal dashed line should be disabled.

- "autogen.sh" that does "ln -s Makefile.release Makefile" or "ln -s Makefile.devel Makefile" depending on args. The difference would be that the release makefile expects precompiled .c files and does not do any deps checking i.e. "compile once".
